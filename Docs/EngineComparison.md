Importing assets in Godot was fairly easy. I found my Godot Project in Explorer. From there, I grab my models file from my Kenney Assets Download and then copy and paste it into my Godot project.  I made sure to create a folder named "AddOns" to import models organized in my project. I created this folder for every game engine.  I then opened my project in Godot and allowed it to import the files I added.  After a couple of seconds, I was able to use my assets. This process was similar to how I imported the Kenny assets in Unity.  For Unreal, I had some difficulty. I assumed the process would be the same, but I encountered an error and found that dragging and dropping the "Model" file into the folder in the game engine, imported all the assets together.  Before, I had to select an import for each individual asset (I don't have the patience for that).



Instancing was fairly easy in Unity; I dragged and dropped the assets into their corresponding parent class and then created Prefabs by dragging the object into the assets. For Unreal, I created a blueprint. This felt like the same process as Godot, but I instead created a scene.



I would choose between Unity and Unreal because Godot can be slightly confusing with the Nodes and scene creation.
